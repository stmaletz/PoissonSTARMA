### R code for reproducing the results from the work "Spatio-temporal Modeling of Count Data" by Maletz, Fokianos and Fried

The repository is structured as follows:
1. The file `glmSTARMA_1.01.tar.gz` contains a preliminary version of an `R`-package for estimation of  PSTARMA und PSTARMAX models.
2. The directory `Simulations` contains the code for reproducing the simulation results.
3. The directory `Data Example` contains the datasets and analysis used in the data example section.
	- The rota virus data is copied from the repository https://github.com/ostojanovic/BSTIM. Originally this data is provided by the  [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de) via the *SurvNet* surveillance system. Information about the shape of counties within Germany is publicly provided by the [German federal agency for cartography and geodesy (Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie)](http://www.bkg.bund.de/) (© GeoBasis-DE / BKG 2018) under the [dl-de/by-2-0 license](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0).
	- The Chicago crime dataset is loaded in a preprocessed form from the `R`-package `PNAR`. The data is originally retrieved from the repository https://github.com/nick3703/Chicago-Data.
